I’m excited to kick off my **cybersecurity** journey with you here on Patreon! As someone who is constantly exploring the world of **pentesting** and **red teaming**, I can’t wait to share what I’m learning, what works, and what doesn’t. I’m far from an expert — I’m just a wanderer in this realm, but that’s what makes this journey exciting.

On this page, I’ll be sharing exclusive content, tutorials, and insights as I dive deeper into the world of **ethical hacking** and beyond. Your support helps me continue this adventure and motivates me to push further in exploring all things **cybersecurity**.

Stay tuned for the first of many posts, and thank you for being part of this learning experience!

For my first walkthrough I will solve the Trusted Chain from Vulnlab. It is considered to be an easy chain but in my opinion it was challenging and helps me with the push harder mentality. 

This chain consists of a parent domain `trusted.vl` and a child domain `lab.trusted.vl`.


```
IP Addresses: 10.10.166.133 10.10.166.134
```
# Enumeration 

I saved the IP Addresses in a targets file so I can do my scanning easier this way. 

```bash
sudo nmap -sC -sV -A -iL targets -oN trustedServiceScan
```

The full walkthrough will be posted later this evening

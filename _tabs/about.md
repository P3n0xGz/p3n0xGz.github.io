I'm currently building my skills in offensive security, focusing on penetration testing, red teaming, and exploit development. While I’m still learning, I actively work on real-world scenarios through CTFs, mock pentests, and hands-on research to gain practical experience.

Right now, I’m exploring web and network security, Windows exploitation, and cloud security to expand my knowledge. I document my learning process through walkthroughs and research notes to reinforce my understanding and share insights with others.
